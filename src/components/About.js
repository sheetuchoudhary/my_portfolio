            I'm an engineering student at Avantika University 
            with a passion for inspiring and supporting others to reach their full potential. 
            I value building meaningful connections and believe in leading 
            with empathy, optimism, and a strong sense of fairness. 
            Driven by a desire to make a positive impact, I thrive on bringing people together, 
            solving problems, and creating meaningful change.
